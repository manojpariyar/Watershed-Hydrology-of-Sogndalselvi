# Watershed-Hydrology-of-Sogndalselvi

Climate change has severely threatened global water resources, and has resulted in shifting precipitation patterns. The consequences of these changes will gravely impact communities and ecosystems, causing great socio-economic and environmental damages. While Norwayâ€™s vulnerability to climate change is low compared to other countries, the country will suffer from adverse effects of climate change unless preventive and mitigative measures are taken. Under the RCP8.5 scenario adopted by the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change, Norway will experience an annual precipitation increase of ca.18%. In order to assist in climate adaptive measures to be taken in Norway, a hydrological analysis of the Sogndalselvi Watershed was conducted in this study. ArcGIS and Nevina were used to determine the characteristics of the watershed and sub-watersheds. The Rational Method was used to calculate the 200-year flood discharge of each sub-watershed. This study provides an overview of the characteristics, discharge and sensitivity to land use change of ten major sub-watersheds of Sogndalselvi.
